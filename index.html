                            <p>For the bread pudding:</p>
                            <li>3/4 cup (177 milliliters) full-fat canned coconut milk</li>
                            <li>3 cups (7 deciliters) of 3/4' cubes of stale brioche, challah or French bread (use gluten-free, whole grain, regular or dairy-free bread, if desired)</li>
                            <li>3 tablespoons raisins</li>
                            <li>1 large egg, room temperature</li>
                            <li>3 tablespoons granulated sugar or raw sugar</li>
                            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
                            <li>pinch of salt"</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="instructions">
                            Instructions: </p>
                            <p>1. Preheat the oven to 350 °F (175 °C) and grease two 1-cup (8-ounce) ramekins. If you only have smaller ones, then you'll need to use 3 and adjust the baking time.</p>
                            <p>2. In a medium or large saucepan (one large enough for all the bread) over medium heat, heat the coconut milk until hot and steamy. Remove the pan from the heat and cool for 3 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the remaining bread pudding ingredients. After the 3 minutes of cooling, add the bread and raisins to the warm coconut milk and gently stir until combined. Add the egg and sugar mixture to the bread mixture and stir until well combined.</p>
                            <p>3. Scoop the mixture into the prepared ramekins. Place the ramekins on a baking sheet to catch any spills. The mixture will be well over the ramekins' rims but it will cook down.</p>
                            <p>4. Bake for 30-40 minutes or until the topping is firm and browned. It will puff up quite a bit in the oven but will gradually 'deflate' after you remove it from the oven. When there are about 5 minutes left on the timer, start preparing the sauce.</p>
                            <p>5. In a small saucepan over medium heat, stir together all the sauce ingredients. Bring to a simmer, while stirring frequently, and then remove from the heat. The sugar should be dissolved.</p>
                            <p>6. When you remove the bread puddings from the oven, use a knife to run around the edge of the ramekins so that the sauce will be more easily absorbed. Pour the hot bourbon sauce over the bread puddings. The bread puddings do not reheat well but if you have leftover sauce, you can refrigerate that for a few days. If you wish to serve these on a plate instead of in the ramekin, I found it easier to remove them after pouring the sauce over them.</p>

                            <p>1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.</p>
                            <p>2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the macaroni, cook for 8 - 9 minutes. Strain and set aside.</p>
                            <p>3. In a heavy-bottomed large pot over medium heat, melt the butter.</p>
                            <p>4. Sprinkle the flour, white pepper, salt, and cayenne pepper over the melted butter, whisking until smooth and the mixture has thickened slightly.</p>
                            <p>5. Stir in the milk ½ cup at a time ( feel free to eyeball it ), only adding the next half cup once the previous one has been incorporated entirely.</p>
                            <p>6. Add all of the medium cheddar cheese and half of the extra sharp cheddar cheese, stir into the milk/flour sauce until melted. Stir in the macaroni.</p>
                            <p>7. Pour into a 3 quart baking dish. Top with the remaining extra sharp cheddar cheese.</p>
                            <p>8. Bake at 375 F for 30 minutes.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p class="instructions">Instructions:</p>
                            <p>1. Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion along with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently for 3-4 minutes.</p>
                            <p>2. Add garlic and cook for another minute or so, stirring frequently.</p>
                            <p>3. Add ground beef and brown, crumbling it with a spatula.</p>
                            <p>4. Once beef is cooked through, add cumin, chiles in adobo, chili powder and a splash of water.</p>
                            <p>5. Stir to combine and season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
                            <p>6. Add cheese and stir to combine.</p>
                            <p>7. While your filling is cooking, heat a large pot over medium heat with about ½ an inch vegetable oil in it. You will know the oil is ready when you sprinkle a drop of water into the oil and it sizzles.</p>
                            <p>8. Assemble your flautas by spreading ½ a cup of the meat mixture in a line down the middle of the BOTTOM HALF of each tortilla.</p>
                            <p>9. Roll the tortilla away from you and tightly around the filling. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.</p>
                            <p>10. Fry flautas in batches of 2-3 depending on how wide your pot is. Fry them on each side for 1-2 minutes or until the outside is dark golden brown and crispy. If your flautas are cooking too quickly, turn the heat down a bit.</p>
